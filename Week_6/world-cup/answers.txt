Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

after incereasing it stay like fixed

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

after like 4 or 5 it will be good
